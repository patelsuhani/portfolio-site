As a freshman Bioengineering and Computer Science Engineering major at Harvard University, I am driven by my passion for biology and bioengineering. In my first semester, I have completed an introductory Bioengineering class and have already gained a strong foundation in the field. Before joining the university, I was involved in two research projects, one focusing on Gene Therapy and the other on the detection and prevention of food adulteration. I have also performed a case study on the surgical procedure of interior vena cava filter insertion surgery. My interdisciplinary background in both Bioengineering and Computer Science Engineering allows me to approach problems from multiple angles and makes me well-suited for tackling complex issues at the intersection of biology and engineering. I am excited to continue exploring my interests in these fields and to make a meaningful impact in the world through my studies.
