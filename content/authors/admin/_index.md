I am a freshman double majoring in Computer and Information Science Engineering and Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania with a passion for developing Open-source software, solving problems in bioinformatics, and creating medical devices. I have successfully completed classes including Programming Languages and Techniques (Java and OCaml), Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Biomechanics, and Biology and have a strong foundation in the fields of my interest. My interdisciplinary background allows me to approach problems from multiple angles and makes me well-suited for tackling complex issues at the intersection of CS and biomedical technology. I am excited to continue exploring my interests and to make a meaningful impact in the world through my studies.
