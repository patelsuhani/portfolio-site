I am a freshman Bioengineering and Computer Science Engineering major at Harvard University with a passion for biology and bioengineering, particularly in tissue engineering. I have completed an introductory Bioengineering class and have a strong foundation in the field. My interdisciplinary background allows me to approach problems from multiple angles and makes me well-suited for tackling complex issues at the intersection of biology and engineering. I am excited to continue exploring my interests and to make a meaningful impact in the world through my studies.
